            Hi, I am Michael, and I love puns a little too much.

			I want to put my love of puns and my illustration skills to good use (well to use anyway) by making shirts.

        <h2>Why the name, Puritan Designs</h2>
        <p>
            The idea for a fictitious design company came to mind as a Puritan 
            spinoff of the classic phrase, "We spare no expense."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Puritans tend to have a prudish reputation. Of course they would spare 
            <em>every</em> expense. Well, it was funny at the time, and it stuck with me.
            Yet another play on words.
