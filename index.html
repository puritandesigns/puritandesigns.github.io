                    At a convention, they set up a "pet store of the future" that had a
                    gi-normous touchscreen and several iPads running this site.

                    I'm building a card game. All the cards are in Google Sheets 
                    so that I can quickly make changes and collaborate with friends.
                    I then download the sheets into csv's and run this script to display
                    them in the browser. From there, I print 'em, cut 'em and test 'em.

                <p>
                    The card game has a lot of stats to use. There was a lot of math
                    going on at certain points in the game, which really slowed down
                    the game play. I developed this Angular app to handle all the math.

        <h2>Why the name, Puritan Designs</h2>
        <p>
            The idea for a fictitious design company came to mind as a Puritan 
            spinoff of the classic phrase, "We spare no expense."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Puritans tend to have a prudish reputation. Of course they would spare 
            <em>every</em> expense. Well, it was funny at the time, and it stuck with me.
            So now I use it as my moniker.
